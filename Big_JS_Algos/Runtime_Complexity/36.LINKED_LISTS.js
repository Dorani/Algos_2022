//  Linked List, that as its name says, is a linked list of nodes that are represented
//  by a head that is the first node in the list and the tail that is the last one.
// Each node has a reference/pointer to the previous and the next node

//
// The linked list data structure have two types, the first one is single linked list,
// the nodes of this type have a pointer to the next one but not for their previous node.



// Although a linked list is similar to an array, it is not restricted to a declared number of elements.
// Additionally, unlike an array which stores data contiguously in memory or on disk,
// a linked list can easily insert or remove elements without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously.
