# Use the steps in the first approach!
# Now, we need to master some common pattern problem solving patterns


Paterns may include: 
- frequency counter
- multiple pointers
- sliding windown
- divide and conquer
- dynamic programming
- greedy algorithms
- backtracking
- and many many more!

# Frequency counters
This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n2) operations with arrays/strings

Use an obj, to breakdown an array, and quickly compare that breakdown from how another array looks like. This helps improve code significantly.
